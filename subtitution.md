Had a lot of fun on this one, didn't know tee could do that
I have worked with named pipes before, but havent needed to do any process substitution till date, so that was nice too
My solution for the final quition was simply ``/challenge/hack 2> >(/challenge/the) 1> >(/challenge/planet)`` - But they specifically mentioned that pipes would be needed.
I wonder what was the intended answer ?
