Mostly just attcking it with cyberchef, binwalk and other tools.

## Keanu crack the matrix

Just read it well. once you figure out the way, start bruteforcing the input for all ascii values over the keys to get back the plaintext.
(I lost the python script to the sands of time, else would put it here).

## Stairway to Heaven

No clue how this was supposed to be done, but upx -d file + strings on the "decompiled" output gives you the flag in ASCII.
